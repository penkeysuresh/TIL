A View hierarchy is the way views are arranged with each other. In iOS views can be arranged solely through storyboard or through code or a mix of both. The view hierarchy can be visualized as ``window`` at the bottom layer and top most view at the top.

In story board one can easily find the view hierarchy by examining the way views are placed inside the subview. The first view inside the subview is the base view and all the views placed over it are it's subviews.
