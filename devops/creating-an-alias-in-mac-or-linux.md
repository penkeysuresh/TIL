Using ``alias`` command, one can create an alias for a command in unix. Generally these kind of aliases can be put in ``~/.bash_aliases`` file. 

For example by using below line

	`` alias mci="mvn clean install"

one can use ``mci`` instead of the ``mvn clean install`` command from the command line. Don't forget to do ``source ~/.bashrc`` after adding the approriate line in the file.
